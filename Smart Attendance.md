# Project Title: Designing a Scalable and Reliable Attendance Management System.
## Project Description:
In this project, design an architecture for “Smart Attendance” a company that offers smart solutions to schools, universities, and educational institutions.
The goal is to build a highly available, reliable, and scalable, robust and efficient attendance management system that leverages AWS services to handle image processing, face recognition, and data storage.
System utilizes cameras placed in classrooms to capture images every 5 minutes, which are then processed for face recognition in the cloud. The attendance data is stored in a database and made accessible to instructors and students through a web page.
